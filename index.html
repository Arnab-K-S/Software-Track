    <p>Waste management or waste disposal includes the processes and actions required to manage waste from its inception to
        its
        final disposal. This includes the collection, transport, treatment and disposal of waste, together with monitoring
        and regulation of the waste management process and waste-related laws, technologies, economic mechanisms.
    
        Waste can be solid, liquid, or gases and each type has different methods of disposal and management. Waste
        management
        deals with all types of waste, including industrial, biological, household, municipal, organic, biomedical,
        radioactive
        wastes. In some cases, waste can pose a threat to human health. Health issues are associated throughout the entire
        process of waste management. Health issues can also arise indirectly or directly. Directly, through the handling of
        solid waste, and indirectly through the consumption of water, soil and food. Waste is produced by human activity,
        for
        example, the extraction and processing of raw materials. Waste management is intended to reduce adverse effects of
        waste on human health, the environment, planetary resources and aesthetics.
    
        The aim of waste management is to reduce the dangerous effects of such waste on the environment and human health. A
        big
        part of waste management deals with municipal solid waste, which is created by industrial, commercial, and household
        activity.
    
        Waste management practices are not uniform among countries (developed and developing nations); regions (urban and
        rural
        areas), and residential and industrial sectors can all take different approaches.
    
        Proper management of waste is important for building sustainable and liveable cities, but it remains a challenge for
        many developing countries and cities. A report found that effective waste management is relatively expensive,
        usually
        comprising 20%–50% of municipal budgets. Operating this essential municipal service requires integrated systems that
        are
        efficient, sustainable, and socially supported. A large portion of waste management practices deal with municipal
        solid waste (MSW) which is the bulk of the waste that is created by household, industrial, and commercial activity.
        According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), municipal solid waste is expected to reach
        approximately 3.4 Gt by 2050; however, policies and lawmaking can reduce the amount of waste produced in different
        areas
        and cities of the world. Measures of waste management include measures for integrated techno-economic mechanisms
        of a circular economy, effective disposal facilities, export and import control] and optimal sustainable design
        of products that are produced.
    
        In the first systematic review of the scientific evidence around global waste, its management and its impact on
        human
        health and life, authors concluded that about a fourth of all the municipal solid terrestrial waste is not collected
        and
        an additional fourth is mismanaged after collection, often being burned in open and uncontrolled fires – or close to
        one
        billion tons per year when combined. They also found that broad priority areas each lack a "high-quality research
        base",
        partly due to the absence of "substantial research funding", which motivated scientists often require.
        Electronic waste (ewaste) includes discarded computer monitors, motherboards, mobile phones and chargers, compact
        discs
        (CDs), headphones, television sets, air conditioners and refrigerators. According to the Global E-waste Monitor
        2017,
        India generates ~ 2 million tonnes (Mte) of e-waste annually and ranks fifth among the e-waste producing countries,
        after the US, P.R. China, Japan and Germany.</p>
